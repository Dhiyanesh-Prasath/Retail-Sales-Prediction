# Grocery Sales Forecasting

# Abstract

Forecasting product sales is critical in purchasing management, particularly in the Supermarkets and Grocery Stores industry, where accurate predictions are essential for maintaining optimal inventory levels and maximizing profits. This paper explores the challenges of forecasting demand in this industry, considering factors such as fluctuating consumer preferences, seasonal variations, and the introduction of new products and locations. A machine learning-based forecasting model is proposed to enhance the accuracy of sales predictions, specifically tailored to support purchasing decisions without replacing existing subjective methods. The model is evaluated using real-world grocery store data, comparing the performance of various regression algorithms to improve product availability and minimize stockouts or excess inventory.

# Introduction

This project focuses on predicting product sales in the "Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting" Kaggle , leveraging various factors such as items, stores, transactions, holidays, and oil prices. The goal is to ensure optimal stocking levels to meet customer demands effectively. The analysis treats the problem as a supervised learning task, comparing regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, ExtraTreeRegressor, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XgBoost. Additionally, multilayer perception (MLP) and LightGBM frameworks are employed to further enhance forecasting accuracy.
